## Imagen - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://gweb-research-imagen.appspot.com/">Imagen</a>, Google's Text-to-Image Neural Network that beats DALL-E2, in Pytorch. It is the new SOTA for text-to-image synthesis.

Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

It appears neither CLIP nor prior network is needed after all. And so research continues.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install imagen-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen

# unet for imagen

unet1 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = 3,
    layer_attns = (False, True, True, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, True, True, True)
)

unet2 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),
    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)
)

# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)

imagen = Imagen(
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    image_sizes = (64, 256),
    beta_schedules = ('cosine', 'linear'),
    timesteps = 1000,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.5
).cuda()

# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5

text_embeds = torch.randn(4, 256, 768).cuda()
text_masks = torch.ones(4, 256).bool().cuda()
images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade

for i in (1, 2):
    loss = imagen(images, text_embeds = text_embeds, text_masks = text_masks, unet_number = i)
    loss.backward()

# do the above for many many many many steps
# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings from the cascading ddpm

images = imagen.sample(texts = [
    'a whale breaching from afar',
    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',
    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles'
], cond_scale = 2.)

images.shape # (3, 3, 256, 256)
```

With the `ImagenTrainer` wrapper class, the exponential moving averages for all of the U-nets in the cascading DDPM will be automatically taken care of when calling `update`

```python
import torch
from imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, ImagenTrainer

# unet for imagen

unet1 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = 3,
    layer_attns = (False, True, True, True),
)

unet2 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),
    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)
)

# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)

imagen = Imagen(
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    text_encoder_name = 't5-large',
    image_sizes = (64, 256),
    beta_schedules = ('cosine', 'linear'),
    timesteps = 1000,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.5
).cuda()

# wrap imagen with the trainer class

trainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)

# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5

text_embeds = torch.randn(64, 256, 1024).cuda()
text_masks = torch.ones(64, 256).bool().cuda()
images = torch.randn(64, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade

for i in (1, 2):
    loss = trainer(
        images,
        text_embeds = text_embeds,
        text_masks = text_masks,
        unet_number = i,
        max_batch_size = 4        # auto divide the batch of 64 up into batch size of 4 and accumulate gradients, so it all fits in memory
    )

    trainer.update(unet_number = i)

# do the above for many many many many steps
# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings from the cascading ddpm

images = trainer.sample(texts = [
    'a puppy looking anxiously at a giant donut on the table',
    'the milky way galaxy in the style of monet'
], cond_scale = 2.)

images.shape # (2, 3, 256, 256)
```

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a> for the generous sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors out there

- <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for their amazing transformers library. The text encoder portion is pretty much taken care of because of them

- <a href="https://github.com/jorgemcgomes">Jorge Gomes</a> for helping out with the T5 loading code and advice on the correct T5 version

- You? It isn't done yet, chip in if you are a researcher or skilled ML engineer


## Todo

- [x] use huggingface transformers for T5-small text embeddings
- [x] add dynamic thresholding
- [x] add dynamic thresholding DALLE2 and video-diffusion repository as well
- [x] allow for one to set T5-large (and perhaps small factory method to take in any huggingface transformer)
- [x] add the lowres noise level with the pseudocode in appendix, and figure out what is this sweep they do at inference time
- [x] port over some training code from DALLE2
- [x] need to be able to use a different noise schedule per unet (cosine was used for base, but linear for SR)
- [x] just make one master-configurable unet
- [x] complete resnet block (biggan inspired? but with groupnorm) - complete self attention
- [x] complete conditioning embedding block (and make it completely configurable, whether it be attention, film etc)
- [x] consider using perceiver-resampler from https://github.com/lucidrains/flamingo-pytorch in place of attention pooling
- [x] add attention pooling option, in addition to cross attention and film
- [x] add optional cosine decay schedule with warmup, for each unet, to trainer
- [x] switch to continuous timesteps instead of discretized, as it seems that is what they used for all stages - first figure out the linear noise schedule case from the variational ddpm paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=2LdBqxc1Yv
- [x] figure out log(snr) for alpha cosine noise schedule.
- [ ] make sure cascading ddpm can be trained without text condition, and make sure both continuous and discrete time gaussian diffusion works
- [ ] figure out if learned variance was used at all, and remove it if it was inconsequential
- [ ] exercise efficient attention expertise + explore skip layer excitation
- [ ] try out grid attention, compare with linear attention + depthwise convs on qkv
